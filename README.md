## Data
The dataset used in this project is "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data", which contains features computed from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies.

## Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics on the test dataset.

## Conclusion
The models were trained and evaluated, with the results indicating the performance of each model in classifying breast cancer diagnoses.
